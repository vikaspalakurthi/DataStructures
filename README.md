# ðŸ§  DataStructures with Python

Welcome to the **DataStructures** repository!  
This project is a growing collection of classic data structure implementations built from scratch using Python.

Each data structure is implemented in a clear and beginner-friendly way, with code comments to help reinforce understanding.

## ðŸ“Œ What You'll Find Here

| Data Structure     | Status       | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Singly Linked List | ðŸš§ Coming Soon | A linear collection of nodes with forward links |
| Doubly Linked List | ðŸš§ Coming Soon | Nodes with both next and previous references    |
| Trees              | ðŸš§ Coming Soon | Hierarchical structures with parent-child nodes |
| Graphs             | ðŸš§ Coming Soon | Networks of connected nodes (edges & vertices)  |
| Stacks             | ðŸš§ Coming Soon | LIFO data structure using list or linked list   |
| Queues             | ðŸš§ Coming Soon | FIFO structure for ordered processing           |

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To try out the implementations:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/DataStructures.git
   cd DataStructures

2. Run any File:
   ```bash
   python <filenam.py>

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Reinforce core concepts in **data structures and algorithms**
- Improve fluency with **object-oriented programming in Python**
- Build a **reference-friendly**, well-structured repo for interview prep
- Practice clean code and project structure for professional growth
